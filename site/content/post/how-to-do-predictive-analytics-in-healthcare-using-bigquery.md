description: >-
  Healthcare is a major industry where we can do predictive analytics. It is the
  process of using healthcare data-analytics to make predictions based on that
  health data. In the healthcare predictive analysis process, we use data along
  with data science, statistics, and machine learning techniques to create a
  predictive model for forecasting future health events.

before you get started with the Google Analytics sample data set in BigQuery you'll first have to activate your account and set up a project to be able to use BigQuery this project can be just a dummy project but you do need to go through these steps 

so basically you know what you go to consult https://cloud.google.com/  
if you don't have a Google cloud account set up yet you'll basically have to agree to the Terms of Service  and then you can activate at any time usually to have this offer live where you get 300 dollars of credit towards Google cloud through a free trial so if you activate that you'll get 300 dollars of credit and yeah that's a nice way to get started it means you probably won't pay for BigQuery for at least you're your first year so I think that's a 12 month trial but once once you've got it going your account activated all you need to do is create a new project and you can call this test project organization can be none or it can be that this is just the Google Apps domain that I'm working on and we'll create it so the first thing you needs to do is create a project second thing that you need to do to use the sample data set is enable billing okay so I went ahead and set up billing basically says welcome and you get $300 and free credit so you it turns out you got that twelve month three hundred dollar free trial just by default so now you're ready to go ahead and dive into the Google Analytics sample data set so there's two ways to get into the actual BigQuery console one is in the sidebar of the Google cloud platform dashboard you can select BigQuery you could also pin that if we go back let's pin it so that it'll show up at the top where are you okay so let's pin it will show up at the top now so that's this is their new UI so it's console doc cloud at google.com select BigQuery this is their new UI it has what's called standard sequel implemented by default which is nice BigQuery has unfortunately - - sequel versions they have what's called standard sequel which is you know kind of compatible with Postgres or my sequel it's kind of classic sequel and then they have this version called legacy sequel it's a little bit different we just won't want to use that but so the new UI has that implemented by default in the classic UI which I prefer it's a little more clean and straightforward which is that BigQuery dot cloud.google.com if you go to show options and again that you know the BigQuery you eyes are not they're great but they're not the best design there's a lot of buttons and a lot going on so I always just like ctrl F or Apple F whatever for um for text if I can't find it so you always want to uncheck this use legacy sequel dialect box you know if you track it it'll use legacy sequel if you uncheck will use standard also if you want to use standard sequel you can always start your query with a hashtag standard sequel so for purposes of this tutorial we'll be using BigQuery as a bunch of public datasets weather data census data stuff like that in the classic view which I'll link to in the description of this video there is a Google Analytics sample data set sample sessions data this is what we'll be using for the project so if you go to the classic view search Google find the table and hit preview can look at the data that's the nice thing about big queries for no charge you can browse through the data set so kind of toggle around previous/next last they won't they don't charge you for this you can just view the data and look at the look at the schema 

so in the BigQuery class new UI, I don't know what to call this but it's the new UI I guess they have public datasets in a little bit of a different way they have this public dataset marketplace which you know it's a nice UI and it's it kind of matches the look and feel of a lot of their new stuff but it doesn't have the Google Analytics data set in here that I've been able to find so instead of using the new UI we're going to use the classic UI here because it's better to work with the Google Analytics data set so hopefully that's enough for you to get started you know if we can run a basic test query just saying you know select star from this table and we'll see you know we're up and running okay so we got the first thousand results we ran a basic query

we're up and running so we have our BigQuery account enabled we have our billing enabled we created a project and now we're able to use big query
